<h3>Custom catalogue files</h3>

<p align=justify>New catalogue files can be created by means of simple text editor (e.g. <i>Notepad</i>, <i>Crimson Editor</i> etc.). A file have to be stored in the directory with the program binary and the extension have to be changed to
<i>dat</i>. Example: <tt>My catalogue.dat</tt>. Beware of double extensions - <tt>My catalogue.dat.<u>txt</u></tt>.)</p>

<h5>Syntax of the file</h5>
<p align=justify>First line can be header, but it is not mandatory. Next lines are data on eclipsing binaries. Each line
defines one record. The fields are stored on fixed positions, gaps are filled by spaces. Always use decimal point to
divide integer part and decimals.</p>
<p align=justify>Elements for primary and secondary minimum are stored on separated line, they are discriminated
by colon character or '+S' string in the star's designation. Examples: <tt>EK Cep</tt> and <tt>EK+P Cep</tt>
labels data for primary minima, on the other hand, <tt>EK:Cep</tt> and <tt>EK+S Cep</tt> labels data for secondary minima.</p>
