<h3>Daily ephemerides</h3>

<p align=justify>The page <em>Daily ephemerides</em> is designed to find all minima which occur on a specified night.

<h5>Instructions</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>Start the program <em>Ephemerides</em> and click on the tab <i>Daily ephemerides</i>.</p>

<li><p>Enter a date which you want to compute data for. Specify date that is valid before midnight (evening date).</p>

<li><p>In the section <i>Catalogues</i>, check catalogues which shall be researched.</p>

<li><p>In the next section <i>Filters</i>, specify additional conditions for selecting variable stars and times of
minimum. Only records that meet all conditions will be displayed.</p>

<li><p><em>Update</em> button <img src="retry.png" alt="Retry"> to start the processing. The results are displayed 
in the table. Every odd row is tinged by light gray color.</p>

<li><p>If you change the date or other settings, it is necessary to start the computation again.</p>

</ol>

<h5>Meaning of table columns</h5>

<ul>

<li><p><i>Name</i> - variable star designation including constellation, e.g. RT And</p>

<li><p><i>PS</i> - P for primary minimum, S for secondary minimum</p>

<li><p><i>Date</i> and <i>UT</i> - date and time of minimum in Universal time. A date is always
printed in the form year-month-day. A time is displayed in hours and it is always rounded
to the nearest half-hour.</p>

<li><p><i>Az</i> and <i>Alt</i> - apparent altitude of the object in degrees at the time of
minimum. An azimuth is presented as an abbreviation of a direction, e.g. WNW is west-north-west. 
A value of azimuth in degrees can be found in the detailed information (see below).</p>

<li><p><i>R.A.</i> and <i>Dec.</i> - equatorial coordinates of the object. A right ascension is 
shown in hours and minutes, a declination is presented in degrees.</p>

<li><p><i>Type</i> - type of variability. Most frequently used abbreviations are:
<ol><li>EA denotes an eclipsing binary of Algol type, the D parameter is eclipse duration in hours.
    <li>EW denotes an eclipsing binary of W UMa type, the P parameter is period in days.
    <li>EB denotes an eclipsing binary of &beta; Lyr type, the P parameter is period in days.
</ol>
The detailed descrption of variability types can be found in the description of the GCVS catalog - 
<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/gcvs/">link</a>.
</p>

<li><p><i>Mag</i> - brightness in minimum and maximum in magnitudes.</p>

<li><p><i>Catalogue</i> - catalog designation, source of elements that were used for this ephemeris</p>

<li><p><i>Pts</i> - for BRKA catalogue this value denotes a measure of usefulness of visual observation
of the variable star. In user-defined catalogues, this field can be used to express a priority.</p>

<li><p><i>Obj-Moon</i> - distance between the variable star and the Moon (disk center) at time of 
minimum in degrees. It is computed as an angle between two lines observer-object and observer-Moon.</p>

<li><p><i>Remarks</i> - any remarks from the catalogue.</p>

</ul>

<h5>Sorting the table data</h5>

<p align=justify>The data displayed in the table are sorted by its order in the catalogue files. It is possible to change
the sorting order. Click on a gray field in the table heading (field's name). You can also press the <em>Sort</em> button 
<img src="sort.gif" alt="Sort"> on the toolbar. A context menu appears, select a sort key from the menu.</p>

<h5>Displaying detailed information</h5>

<p align=justify>It is possible to show detailed information on the selected eclipsing binary star and the selected 
minimum by pressing the <em>Info</em> button <img src="info.png" alt="Info"> on the toolbar. The information are displayed
in a separated floating panel. The panel consists of two tables located on separated tabs. The <em>Catalogue</em> tab shows 
all information on the selected variable star. The <em>Ephemeris</em> tab includes computed results on the selected minimum - 
predicted time of minimum, heliocentric correction, azimuth and altitude of the star in time of minimum and times of its 
rise, transit and set. If the star do not rise/set, the stars are printed out in this fields. The values of the airmass 
coefficient at the time of minimum, half an hour before and after the minimum are enlisted too.</p>

<p align=justify>The information panel stays on the top of the main window. By selecting another row in the table of 
minima, the content of the panel is automatically updated. You can hide the panel by clicking on the close button 
in its right top corner.</p>

<h5>Deleting rows from the table</h5>

<p align=justify>After coarse selection of the minima by means of the filters, it is possible to make fine selection 
before printing or saving the table to a file. It allows you to make a final plan of an observation. To delete a particular 
row or rows from the table, select them by clicking the left mouse button a press the <tt>Delete</tt> key or the <em>Delete</em>
button <img src="delete.gif" alt="Delete"> on the toolbar.</p>

<h5>Printing the ephemerides</h5>

<p align=justify>You can print the current content of the table on connected printer. Press the <em>Print</em> button 
<img src="print.gif" alt="Print"> on the toolbar. The new window is displayed with a preview. In the window, press 
<em>Print</em> button, check selection and settings of the printer and confirm by the <em>OK</em> button.</p>

<p align=justify>To save space, the first column combines variable star designation, followed by a colon if it is
a secondary minimum (this used to be standard in the BRNO catalogue), followed by the constellation designation. For
example: 'RT:And' is indicated that the row is ephemeris for a secondary minimum of RT And.</p>

<h5>Saving results to a file</h5>

<p align=justify>You can save the current content of the table to a file. Press the <em>Save</em> button 
<img src="save.png" alt="Save"> on the toolbar. The standard save dialog is displayed. You can choose between
several file formats - HTML, ASCII text or CSV.</p>

<h5>Solar and lunar data</h5>

<p align=justify>Time of rising and setting of the Sun and Moon are also important for making observation plan, 
especially for observations of eclipsing binary systems. This is why program also computes and displays this 
information. Press the <em>Sun</em> button <img src="sun.png" alt="Sun"> button to open a new dialog window.
The dialog shows the times of the sunrise, sunset and the start and the end of twilight. All times are in UT.</p>

<p align=justify>The next button <em>Moon</em> <img src="moon.png" alt="Moon"> opens a similar dialog window. The 
dialog shows the phase of the Moon at the date of selected minimum, times of rising and setting of the Moon. All 
times are in UT.</p>

<h5>Sky chart</h5>

<p align=justify>It is possible to show a position of the selected variable star on an overview sky chart with 
bright stars and constellations. Click on the <em>Chart</em> button <img src="sky.png" alt="Chart">. A new dialog
window appears. The dialog shows a sky chart centered on the variable star. The width of the viewfield is about 
40 degrees. The cross in the middle of the chart marks the position of the variable star.</p>
