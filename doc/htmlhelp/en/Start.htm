<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p align=justify>The configuration dialog is automaticaly opened when the program is launched for the
first time. A user shall provide the geographical coordinates of observation site, otherwise the computed 
values won't be valid for the site. You can change the entered values later, in the <a href="Setup.htm">configuration dialog</a>.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Start the program <em>Ephemerides</em>. When the program is started for the first time, the
configuration dialog is automaticaly displayed.</p></li>

<li><p>Enter the name of the observation site and its geographical coordinates - <i>latitude</i> and 
<i>longitude</i>. The values are given in the decimal form, e.g. 16.6667 and 49.2167 for Brno, Czech 
republic. Use <b>positive</b> values of longitude for locations on the <b>eastern</b> hemisphere and 
<b>negative</b> values for the <b>western</b> hemisphere. Use <b>positive</b> values of latitude for 
locations on the <b>northern</b> hemisphere and <b>negative</b> values for the southern hemisphere.</p></li>

<li><p>If your computer is set to the local time zone, you can let the <i>time zone</i> parameter
set to the default value 'Read from system', which means that the program will read the standard time zone 
from the opeating system. Please note, that displayed times of minima, rise times and set times of celestial
objects are presented <b>always in UTC</b>, regardless of the time zone selected.</p></li>

<li><p>Click on the <em>Save</em> button to save configuration settings and close the dialog. Now, 
you have finished the configuration and you can make ephemerides. The settings are saved to the configuration
file and this dialog won't appear. You can change the location in the <a href="Setup.htm"><em>Setup</em></a> 
dialog.</p></li>

<h5>Making daily ephemerides</h5>

<p align=justify>The page <em>Daily ephemerides</em> is designed to find all minima 
for a subset of variable stars which occur on a specified night.</p>

<h5>Instructions</h5>

<ol>

<li><p>Click on the tab <i>Daily ephemerides</i>.</p>

<li><p>Enter a date which you want to compute data for, this field is automaticaly filled with actual date. 
You have to specify the date that is valid before midnight (evening date).</p></li>

<li><p>In the section <i>Catalogues</i>, check all catalogues for simplicity.</p></li>

<li><p>In the next section <i>Filters</i>, specify conditions for selecting variable stars and times of minimum. 
Only records that meet all conditions will be displayed. Check the field <em>Time of minimum</em> and check the
option <em>during nighttime</em>. It means that only minima that occur after the dusk and before dawn will be
displayed. Check the field <em>Altitude</em> and set the field <em>from</em> to the value 25 and the field <em>to
</em> to value 90. It means that only minima that occur on altitudes (elevations) grater than 25 degree will be
listed. You can leave all other filters unchecked.</p></li>

<li><p>Click on the <em>Update</em> button to make a list of minima. If you change the date or filter settings, 
it is necessary to start the computation again.</p></li>

<li><p>For more information about daily ephemerides, see <a href="den.htm">this page</a>.</p></li>

<h5>Making star ephemerides</h5>

<p align=justify>The page <em>Star ephemerides</em> is designed to find all minima for 
a particular variable star that occur in a specified season.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Click on the tab <em>Star ephemerides</em>.</p>

<li><p>In the field <em>Catalogue</em>, choose the catalogue file that shall be researched.</p>

<li><p>In the next field <em>Constellation</em>, choose the constellation that the star is located in. Variables which
do not include the name of the constellation in the name are enlisted in the <em>OTHER</em> group.</p>

<li><p>Select a star in the list of the <em>Variable stars</em>. The colon in the star's name indicates the secondary minimum.</p>

<li><p>Set up the interval of days that the ephemerides shall be computed for - section <em>Date</em>, fields <em>from</em> and <em>to</em>.</p>

<li><p>In the next section <em>Filters</em>, specify additional conditions for filtering minima, which shall be included 
in the results. Only the records that meet all conditions will be displayed. Check the field <em>Time of minimum</em> and check the
option <em>during nighttime</em>. It means that only minima that occur after the dusk and before dawn will be
displayed. Check the field <em>Altitude</em> and set the field <em>from</em> to the value 25 and the field <em>to
</em> to value 90. It means that only minima that occur on altitudes (elevations) grater than 25 degree will be
listed. You can leave all other filters unchecked.</p></li>

<li><p>Click on the <em>Update</em> button to make a list of minima. If you change the date or filter settings, 
it is necessary to start the computation again.</p></li>
