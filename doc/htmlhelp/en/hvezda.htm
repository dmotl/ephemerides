<h3>Star's ephemerides</h3>

<p align=justify>The page <em>Star's ephemerides</em> is designed to find all minima for a particular 
eclipsing binary star that occur in a specified season.</p>

<h5>Instructions</h5>

<ol>
<li><p>Start the program <em>Ephemerides</em> and click on the tab <em>Star's ephemerides</em>.</p>

<li><p>In the field <em>Catalogue</em>, choose the catalogue file that shall be researched.</p>

<li><p>In the next field <em>Constellation</em>, choose the constellation that the star is located in. 
Variables which do not include the name of the constellation in the name are enlisted in the 
<em>OTHER</em> group.</p>

<li><p>Select a star in the list of the <em>Variable stars</em>. The colon in the star's name indicates 
the secondary minimum.</p>

<li><p>Set up the interval of days that the ephemerides shall be computed for - section <em>Date</em>, 
fields <em>from</em> and <em>to</em>.</p>

<li><p>In the next section <em>Filters</em>, specify additional conditions for filtering minima, which shall 
be included in the results. Only the records which meet all conditions, will be displayed in the table.</p>

<li><p>Press the <em>Update</em> button <img src="retry.png" alt="Retry"> to start the processing. The 
results are displayed in the table. Every odd row is tinged by light gray color.</p>

<li><p>If you change the date or other settings, it is necessary to start the computation again.</p>
</ol>

<h5>Description of columns</h5>

<ul>

<li><p><i>Date</i> and <i>UT</i> - date and time of minimum in Universal time. A date is always
printed in the form year-month-day. A time is displayed in hours and it is always rounded
to the nearest half-hour.</p>

<li><p><i>Day of week</i> - days of week that corresponds to a local night, which the minimum 
occurs in. It is presented as the day of week before local midnight, slash and the day of week 
after midnight.</p>

<li><p><i>Julian date</i> - Julian date of minimum.</p>

<li><p><i>Epoch</i> - epoch (number of periods between the base minimum and the displayed minimum).</p>

<li><p><i>PS</i> - P for primary minimum, S for secondary minimum</p>

<li><p><i>Az</i> a <i>Alt</i> - apparent altitude of the object in degrees at the time of
minimum. An azimuth is presented as an abbreviation of a direction, e.g. WNW is west-north-west. 
A value of azimuth in degrees can be found in the detailed information (see below).</p>

<li><p><i>Moon</i> - Lunar disk illumination expressed in percents; an additional character
denotes the trend: A plus sign means that the illuminated fraction is increasing, a minus sign
means that it is decresing.</p>

<li><p><i>Obj-Moon</i> - distance between the variable star and the Moon (disk center) at time of 
minimum in degrees. It is computed as an angle between two lines observer-object and observer-Moon.</p>

</ul>

<h5>Sorting the table data</h5>

<p align=justify>The results displayed in the table are sorted by julian date by default. It is possible to sort 
the items by other key. Click on a gray field in the table heading with field's name. You can also press the 
<em>Sort</em> button <img src="sort.gif" alt="Sort"> on the toolbar. A context menu appears, select a sort key 
from the menu.</p>

<h5>Displaying detailed information</h5>

<p align=justify>It is possible to show detailed information on the selected eclipsing binary star and the selected 
minimum by pressing the <em>Info</em> button <img src="info.png" alt="Info"> on the toolbar. The information are displayed
in a separated floating panel. The panel consists of two tables located on separated tabs. The <em>Catalogue</em> tab shows 
all information on the selected variable star. The <em>Ephemeris</em> tab includes computed results on the selected minimum - 
predicted time of minimum, heliocentric correction, azimuth and altitude of the star in time of minimum and times of its 
rise, transit and set. If the star do not rise/set, the stars are printed out in this fields. The values of the airmass 
coefficient at the time of minimum, half an hour before and after the minimum are enlisted too.</p>

<p align=justify>The information panel stays on the top of the main window. By selecting another row in the table of 
minima, the content of the panel is automatically updated. You can hide the panel by clicking on the close button 
in its right top corner.</p>

<h5>Deleting rows from the table</h5>

<p align=justify>After coarse selection of the minima by means of the filters, it is possible to make fine selection 
before printing or saving the table to a file. It allows you to make a final plan of an observation. To delete a particular 
row or rows from the table, select them by clicking the left mouse button a press the <tt>Delete</tt> key or the <em>Delete</em>
button <img src="delete.gif" alt="Delete"> on the toolbar.</p>

<h5>Printing the ephemerides</h5>

<p align=justify>You can print the current content of the table on connected printer. Press the <em>Print</em> button 
<img src="print.gif" alt="Print"> on the toolbar. The new window is displayed with a preview. In the window, press 
<em>Print</em> button, check selection and settings of the printer and confirm by the <em>OK</em> button.</p>

<h5>Saving results to a file</h5>

<p align=justify>You can save the current content of the table to a file. Press the <em>Save</em> button 
<img src="save.png" alt="Save"> on the toolbar. The standard save dialog is displayed. You can choose between
several file formats - HTML, ASCII text or CSV.</p>

<h5>Solar and lunar data</h5>

<p align=justify>Time of rising and setting of the Sun and Moon are also important for making observation plan, 
especially for observations of eclipsing binary systems. This is why program also computes and displays this 
information. Press the <em>Sun</em> button <img src="sun.png" alt="Sun"> button to open a new dialog window.
The dialog shows the times of the sunrise, sunset and the start and the end of twilight. All times are in UT.</p>

<p align=justify>The next button <em>Moon</em> <img src="moon.png" alt="Moon"> opens a similar dialog window. The 
dialog shows the phase of the Moon at the date of selected minimum, times of rising and setting of the Moon. All 
times are in UT.</p>

<h5>Sky chart</h5>

<p align=justify>It is possible to show a position of the selected variable star on an overview sky chart with 
bright stars and constellations. Click on the <em>Chart</em> button <img src="sky.png" alt="Chart">. A new dialog
window appears. The dialog shows a sky chart centered on the variable star. The width of the viewfield is about 
40 degrees. The cross in the middle of the chart marks the position of the variable star.</p>
